    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
    <div class="center">
        <p class="intro">Since starting my master’s degree in library and information science part time I have been able to find job opportunities that allow me to utilize my previous experience and blend together what I learned while completing my degrees to transition into a career in research administration.</p>
        <p>While working as a Technology Specialist at Mid-Continent Public Library I had my first taste of working as a trainer. I did enjoy the position, but I wanted a job that would blend all my education and experience together.</p>
        <p>Working at the University of Kansas gave me a clear picture of the various research administration roles available. The transparency of the senior administration and their willingness to promote from within gave me the chance to explore different ways I could advance my career in research administration.</p>
        <p>My position at KUMC was my first chance to blend all my experience and education. This was a great starting point for where I want to end up eventually. This was a central office pre-award research administration position that focused on training and support. Eventually I want.to move into a central office accounting or post-award research administration position that focuses on training and support.</p>
