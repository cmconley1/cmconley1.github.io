Hello, I’m Chelsea Conley and this website is all about my education and work experience. The purpose of this website is to showcase the versatility of my background and why I would be an asset to any team. 
My goal is for the website to give a clear picture of how I can be an asset to an employer in a wide range of positions. I will achieve this through two objectives: 1) to list at least 3 previous work positions that incorporate a description that focuses on the use of at least two of my degrees and 2) to detail in one paragraph how my degrees work together to make me a versatile employee.
