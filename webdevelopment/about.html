  <h3>About Me</h3>
  
  <p>Hello! My name is Chelsea Conley. I am pursuing a Master’s Degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) at the University of Missouri (MU). I will graduate with my MLIS in May of 2024. I selected MU based on the endorsement of my former co-workers. I already have a Master of Science in Accounting from the University of Missouri Kansas City and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from MU. I enjoy reading and when I was younger, I started volunteering at my local friends of the public library. For about eight years I worked in a public library starting as a page then switching to a Circulation Assistant then to a Technology Associate. Recently I worked in research administration at a university developing online learning solutions. My current hobby is art journaling. Well, that is some information about me. You will find information on this website about my educational background, work history, and career goals.</p>
  <p>Once I graduate, I will have three degrees. A MLIS, a Master of Science in Accounting, and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from MU.</p>
