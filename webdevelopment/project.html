    <h3>University of Kansas Medical Center: October 2023  – Current</h3>
    <h4>Grant Administrator</h4>
    <p>At KUMC I worked on the pre-award team for our central offices providing online training and support for principal investigators without any department level support. I helped them build realistic budgets, meet sponsor requirements for application materials, and submitted the required information for approval and signature. I also assisted with the development of training materials that were used across campus. Specifically, I helped create job aids for the newly adopted Huron Grants software for use across campus.
      This position was a great way to build on my previous research administration experience and blend my business and accounting knowledge with the training strategies and curriculum development skills I’m learning in my MLIS.

    <h3>University of Kansas: June 2019  – October 2023</h3>
    <h4>Grant Coordinator</h4>
    <p>On the main University of Kansas campus, I maintained the department level accounting records for all awards within my assigned portfolio. I also prepared funding scenarios and conducted expenditure forecasting for award management. I met with principal investigators regularly to review award a discuss payroll to ensure payroll deadlines were consistently met.
      Working as a Grant Coordinator at KU allowed me to use my accounting knowledge in a university setting with a focus on research administration. This position was an import steppingstone in for my long term career goals.

    <h3>Mid-Continent Public Library: September 2013 – June 2021</h3>
    <h4>Technology Specialist</h4>
    <p>I worked at MCPL for almost 8 years. In my last role I had the opportunity to be an in-person technology trainer. I assisted library customers with technology-related troubleshooting. I also answered questions and provided one-to-one technology training. I would still assist with other library responsibilities as needed.   
      This position was my first opportunity to be in a role that focused substantially on training.  On reflection this position gives me a different perspective than my most recent training role since this is in person training instead of online training.
